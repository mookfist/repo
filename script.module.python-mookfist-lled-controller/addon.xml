    <summary lang="en"># Mookfist LimitlessLED Controller v0.0.3

Intended as a simple wrapper around the LimitlessLED wifi protocol written in python.

Currently only supports version 4 (and possibly version 5) but is designed to support multiple versions.

There are some differences from the original LimitlessLED protocol:

1. Brightness is a percentage between 0 and 100. LimitlessLED protocol's brightness ranges from 2 to 27
2. Color is a value between 0 and 255 and starts and ends with the color red. LimitlesLED protocol's color starts from blue

## Installation

Download the code: https://github.com/mookfist/mookfist-limitlessled-controller/archive/master.zip

```
$ unzip master.zip
$ python setup.py install
$ python lled.py --help
```

## API

The API is currently not documented but these examples should help get you going.

### API Examples
```python
# Set brightness to 50% for groups 1 and 2
from mookfist_lled_controller import WifiBridge
from mookfist_lled_controller import get_bridge

ip, macaddr = get_bridge(version=4)

bridge = WifiBridge(ip, 8899, version=4)
bridge.brightness(50, 1)
bridge.brightness(50, 2)
```

```python
# Set color to 128 for group 1
from mookfist_lled_controller import WifiBridge
from mookfist_lled_controller import get_bridge

ip, macaddr = get_bridge(version=4)

bridge = WifiBridge(ip, 8899, version=4)
bridge.color(128, 1)
```

```python
# Fade groups 1 through 4 from 100% to 0%
# This is a blocking operation
from mookfist_lled_controller import WifiBridge
from mookfist_lled_controller import get_bridge
from mookfist_lled_controller import fade_brightness

ip, macaddr = get_bridge(version=4)
bridge = WifiBridge(ip, 8899, version=4)

fade_brightness(bridge, (1,2,3,4), 100, 0)
```

```python
# Fade color from 0 to 255 for groups 2 and 3
# This is a blocking operation
from mookfist_lled_controller import WifiBridge
from mookfist_lled_controller import get_bridge
from mookfist_lled_controller import fade_brightness

ip, macaddr = get_bridge(version=4)
bridge = WifiBridge(ip, 8899, version=4)

fade_color(bridge, (1,2,3,4), 0, 255)
```

```python
# Fade group 1 from 0 to 100% rather slowly
from mookfist_lled_controller import WifiBridge
from mookfist_lled_controller import get_bridge
from mookfist_lled_controller import fade_brightness

ip, macaddr = get_bridge(version=4)
bridge = WifiBridge(ip, 8899, version=4, pause=50, repeat=5)

fade_brightness(bridge, (1), 0, 100)
```


## Command Line Interface

The lled.py script allows you to control your lights from the command line.

### Commands

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| fade &lt;start&gt; &lt;end&gt;   | Fade brightness from &lt;start&gt; to &lt;end&gt;. Values can be between 0 and 100 |
| fadec &lt;start&gt; &lt;end&gt; | Fade the color from &lt;start&gt; to &lt;end&gt;. Values can be between 0 and 255 |
| color &lt;color&gt; | Set color to &lt;color&gt;. Value can be between 0 and 255 |
| brightness &lt;brightness&gt; | Set the brightness to &lt;brightness&gt;. Value can be between 0 and 255 |


### Options
| Argument | Description | Default Value |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| --repeat | Number of times to repeat a command. Increasing this value could improve smoothness, but means it will take a longer time to perform fades | 1 |
| --pause  | Number of milliseconds to pause between sending commands. Decreasing this value below 100ms might mean some commands are not processed | 100 |
| --group  | Group number. Repeat the argument for each group you want to send a command to | n/a |
| --debug  | Turn on debug logging | false |
| --host   | The IP/hostname of the bridge. If omitted the bridge will be automatically scanned down | n/a |
| --port   | The port number of the bridge. | 8899 |
| --version | The version of the LimitlessLED protocol | 4 |


### Examples


Fade light group 1 to 0% brightness

```
$ python lled.py fade 100 0 --group 1
```

Set color to groups 1 and 2
```
$ python lled.py color 128 --group 1 --group 2
```

Set brightness to 50% for group 3
```
$ python lled.py brightness 50 --group 3
```

## Tweaking

The repeat and pause values can be used to tweak how commands are sent. In general, you should wait 100ms between each command sent. But since there is no native fading in LimitlessLED, to achieve fading, the controller sends multiple commands to fade from one value to another.

If the pause is too small, some commands might get missed. But this is what the repeat setting can fix. You can send the same command more than once.

Getting smooth fading is not very easy with the wifi protocol, but you might be able to get better results by playing with these two values</summary>
